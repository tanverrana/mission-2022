            <p>We are brought together by a sense of belonging. Being a part of a group might make us feel like we're
                part of something bigger than ourselves. It can provide us with possibilities to interact with others,
                to achieve our objectives, and to feel protected and secure. It is critical for everyone to feel a sense
                of belonging.
